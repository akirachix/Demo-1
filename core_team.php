She has one of those curious minds that seek to learn, understand, challenge and improve the way things work. She is a tech enthusiast and values it mainly for the impact it has, and has potential to have, on: individual lives, businesses, governance and policy. She met Akirachix while in high school and after interacting with the iHub community for about 6months, the aspiring Economist became sold to the world of technology. She has 2 major goals in Akirachix. One is to enable other girls to see the light that she was lucky enough to see. The other is to see growth in numbers but more importantly, growth in terms of quality (skill-wise) of women in tech.
